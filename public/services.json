        "details": "Full stack web development refers to the process of developing both client- and server-s_ide software. That means you can expect anyone with full stack included in their job title to have expertise in several front- and backend languages and frameworks. On the frontend, mastery in HTML and CSS is a common requirement for the field. Developers also tend to use JavaScript, jQuery, or Angular when developing a browser platform. Concerning the backend, full stack development consists of programming servers and databases. A server might call for code in PHP, ASP, Python, or Node, while a database can accept languages like SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB."

However, it is not cons_idered as pure object-oriented as it prov_ides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc). Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not prov_ide low-level programming functionalities like pointers. Also, Java code is always written in the form of classes and objects. Andro_id heavily relies on the Java programming language all the SDKs required to build for andro_id applications use the standard libraries of Java. If one is coming from a traditional programming background like C, C++, Java is easy to learn. So in this discussion, there is a complete gu_ide to learn Java specifically cons_idering Andro_id App Development."
